A living document of the tools, software, and hardware I use on a daily basis.

## Editor

- **Neovim** — My primary editor for everything
- **VS Code** — When I need a full IDE experience

## Development

- **Ruby** and **Rails** — My bread and butter
- **PostgreSQL** — The database I reach for first
- **Redis** — For caching and background jobs

## Terminal

- **Alacritty** or **Kitty** — Fast, GPU-accelerated terminals
- **tmux** — For session management
- **zsh** — With a minimal configuration

## Hardware

- More details coming soon...
