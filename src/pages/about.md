Hello, I'm Andrei Maxim. I'm a Ruby developer based in Romania.

I've been building web applications for over a decade, mostly with Ruby on Rails. I care about clean code, performance, and creating software that's a joy to use.

This site is my digital garden where I write about Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
