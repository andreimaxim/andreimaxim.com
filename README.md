# A Part of IndieWeb

Hello, my URL is [https://andreimaxim.com]().

Today's internet revolves around social media platforms, which have been
optimized to increase user interaction at the expense of long-form writing
(there's a reason why services like [Threadreader](https://threadreaderapp.com/)
exist) and searchability (have you ever tried finding a post on Facebook?).

But I am a builder, not just an user, and I want to build my
[indie web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNmKO7Gr4TE).
